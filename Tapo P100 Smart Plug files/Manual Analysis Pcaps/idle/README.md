# Tapo P100 Tp-Link Smart Plug - idle traffic

This PCAP contains a trace of approximately 8 hours of the captured **IDLE** traffic.

#### Note: At one point, packet no. 470, the monitored smart plug reconnects itself to the hotspot and obtains a new IP, which triggers a new TLS Handshake and DNS requests.

### Relevant addresses information in the PCAP:

#### IoT device
- **Initial Tapo plug IP address: 192.168.137.126**
- **Final Tapo plug IP address: 192.168.137.97**
- **Tapo plug MAC address: 98:25:4a:50:4f:95**
- Main servers the plug contacts:
    - **security.iot.i.tplinknbu.com** - cloud server responsable most probably for firmware updates with resolved IPs (34.243.103.189 / 54.170.92.104)
    - **euw1-device-cloudgateway.iot.i.tplinknbu.com** - cloud server responsable to deliver actions initiated from the APP and get status updates from the IoT with resolved IPs (34.243.103.189/54.170.92.104)
    - Remaining are NTP and other irrelevant IPs

#### Hotspot config
- **Gateway IP: 192.168.137.1**
- **MAC address: 8e:96:e6:3d:59:17**

#### NOTE: Use the following wireshark filter for a better visualization:
	(not mdns and not llmnr and not bootp and not nbns and not icmpv6 and not icmp and not igmp and not arp and not ssdp)

## Observations
Not much activity. Each 3/4 minutes we observe TLS traffic generated by the IoT to the cloud server. Most probably ping requests. The request initates from the device, 123 bytes packet, and the answer from the cloud service is another 123 bytes packet.
